#SQL Database 

## Description

In this project, I created a database using SQL to manage information for the association of students at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
The database includes several key entities such as volunteers, projects, tasks, and departments. Each entity is interconnected to help organize and track various activities within the association.

- Volunteers: Stores information about the students involved in different activities, including their personal details and roles in projects.
- Projects: Tracks the various initiatives or events organized by the association, including project names, objectives, and timelines.
- Tasks: Defines the specific tasks within each project, assigning responsibilities to volunteers and tracking their progress.
- Departments: Organizes volunteers and projects into specific academic or operational categories based on the faculty's structure.
  
To make the database user-friendly, I developed a Python interface that allows for easy interaction with the database, offering functionalities such as adding, updating, and querying data in a simple and efficient manner.
 This interface ensures that users can easily manage and access the information stored within the database.
